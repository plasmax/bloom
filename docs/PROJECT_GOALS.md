- Support context-aware code generation
- Facilitate code improvement suggestions
- Enable interactive debugging assistance

### 3. Development Workflow
- Support iterative development process
- Enable code versioning and history
- Provide project management capabilities
- Facilitate collaborative development

### 4. User Experience
- Offer intuitive web interface
- Support mobile access
- Enable real-time feedback
- Provide clear error messages and suggestions
- Support both novice and experienced developers

### 5. Deployment Flexibility
